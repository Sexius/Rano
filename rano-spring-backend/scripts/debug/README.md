# Debug Scripts & Artifacts

This directory contains temporary debug scripts, log files, and other artifacts used during the development and troubleshooting of the RAG backend.

## Files
- `debug_*.py`: Python scripts used for testing specific features (crawling, pagination, etc.).
- `*.log`: Server execution logs.
- `*.html`: HTML snapshots from the crawler.
- `check_api.py`, `diagnose_backend.py`: Connectivity test scripts.
- `SimpleSpringServer.java`: A standalone server file (possibly deprecated in favor of the Spring Boot application structure).

> [!NOTE]
> `python-crawler-server.py` is the main crawler service and resides in the parent directory.
